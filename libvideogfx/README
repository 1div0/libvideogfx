INTRODUCTION

  LibVideoGfx is a C++ library for low-level video processing. It aims at
  speeding up the development process for image and video processing
  applications by providing high-level classes for commonly required tasks.
  The library comprises support for:

    - basic image data classes
    - color-space convertion for RGB, YUV, HSV
    - drawing primitives (lines, circles, ...)
    - image manipulation (scaling, pixel-ops, convolution)
    - file-IO (ppm, yuv, jpeg, mpeg, V4L-grabbing)
    - X11 image display (including Xv-extension support)

  Furthermore, it includes support for:

    - bit-stream reading/writing
    - commonly used container classes (dynamic array, heap, queue, ...)
    - processor feature detection

  LibVideoGfx includes MMX accelerated routines, which are used if an MMX
  capable processor is detected. However, the library provides scalar
  replacement routines and can thus be compiled on all UNIX platforms
  (including CygWin).

  JPEG file access requires the libjpeg. If this library cannot be detected
  during library configuration, JPEG support is disabled.
  The MPEG reader depends on the DVDview MPEG decoding program.
